# Deploy the AKS clusters in two different regions

Now that you've [generated your client-facing and AKS ingress controller TLS certificates](./05-ca-certificates.md), the next step in the [AKS baseline multi cluster reference implementation](/README.md) is deploying the AKS clusters and its associated Azure resources.

## Expected results

Following these steps will result in the provisioning of the AKS multi-cluster solution.

| Object | Purpose |
|:- |:- |
| GitHub Actions workflow | A GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the multi-cluster infrastructure in two different regions. |
| Two Azure Application Gateways | One Azure Application Gateway in East US 2 and another one in its paired region Central US. |
| Two AKS clusters | Two AKS clusters in the identified regions, both bootstrapped with their initial desired state. Also includes Flux, workload identity, and more. |

## Steps

> :book: The selected locations are East US 2 and Central US, which are Azure paired regions. The team's goal is to have a single CI/CD pipeline that is aware of the multiple clusters being deployed, and that can take measures in case of errors while deploying for a particular region. This pipeline uses a common stamp for the cluster creation, with different parameter files per region. The pipeline enrols the AKS clusters in GitOps to initialize the cluster's desired state. From there, Flux takes care of the AKS cluster bootstrapping process.
>
> In this case, the app team decides to use GitHub Actions. They create a workflow that groups all AKS clusters in different regions that are serving the same application. They know that every change in their cluster stamp or workflow will affect all clusters. If they want to exclude certain changes from triggering the pipeline, they can tag the pipeline execution to exclude them.

> :bulb: The multi-cluster and bootstrapping repos could be a monorepo or multiple repos as displayed from the diagram above. In this reference implementation, the workload manifests, and Bicep files are shipped together from a single repo.

> :bulb: Another interesting use case that this architecture could help with is when AKS introduces preview features in the same or different regions. In some cases, preview features could be breaking changes that will eventually come in a future major release, such as what happened with the switch to containerd as the default runtime. In those situations, you might want to do some A/B testing without disrupting your live and stable AKS cluster.

1. Retrieve some of the shared services resource details from deployments in earlier steps.

   ```bash
   LOGANALYTICSWORKSPACEID=$(az deployment group show -g $SHARED_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_AKS_MRB -n shared-svcs-stamp --query properties.outputs.logAnalyticsWorkspaceId.value -o tsv)
   CONTAINERREGISTRYID=$(az deployment group show -g $SHARED_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_AKS_MRB -n shared-svcs-stamp --query properties.outputs.containerRegistryId.value -o tsv)
   export ACR_NAME_AKS_MRB=$(az deployment group show -g $SHARED_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_AKS_MRB -n shared-svcs-stamp --query properties.outputs.containerRegistryName.value -o tsv)
   
   echo LOGANALYTICSWORKSPACEID: $LOGANALYTICSWORKSPACEID
   echo CONTAINERREGISTRYID: $CONTAINERREGISTRYID
   echo ACR_NAME_AKS_MRB: $ACR_NAME_AKS_MRB
   ```

1. Import the Traefik container image to your container registry.

   > Public container registries are subject to faults such as outages (no SLA) or request throttling. Interruptions like these can be crippling for an application that needs to pull an image *right now*. To minimize the risks of using public registries, store all applicable container images in a registry that you control, such as the SLA-backed Azure Container Registry.

   If you have your own Docker Hub account, use the following command to provide the credentials during the import process:

   ```bash
   az acr import --source docker.io/library/traefik:v2.11 -n $ACR_NAME_AKS_MRB --force --username YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME --password YOUR_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD_OR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

   If you don't have a Docker Hub account, use the following command, but note that you might receive a rate limit failure and need to retry repeatedly:

   ```bash
   az acr import --source docker.io/library/traefik:v2.11 -n $ACR_NAME_AKS_MRB --force
   ```

1. Retrieve the resource IDs of the spoke virtual networks.

   > :book: In each region, the app team will be deploying the clusters into a spoke VNet for application A0042, which was already provisioned by the network team.

   ```bash
   CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_03=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0042-03 --query properties.outputs.clusterSpokeVnetName.value -o tsv)
   CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_04=$(az deployment group show -g rg-enterprise-networking-spokes -n spoke-BU0001A0042-04 --query properties.outputs.clusterSpokeVnetName.value -o tsv)
   echo CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_03: $CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_03
   echo CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_04: $CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_04
   ```

1. Assign permissions to the [GitHub workflow's](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure) managed (federated) identity.

   ```bash
   # Get the managed identity to assign necessary deployment permissions
   GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_PRINCIPALID=$(az deployment group show -g $SHARED_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_AKS_MRB -n shared-svcs-stamp --query 'properties.outputs.githubFederatedIdentityPrincipalId.value' -o tsv)
   echo GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_PRINCIPALID: $GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_PRINCIPALID

   # Assign built-in Contributor RBAC role for creating resource groups and performing deployments at subscription level
   az role assignment create --assignee $GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_PRINCIPALID --role 'Contributor' --scope "/subscriptions/$(az account show --query 'id' -o tsv)"

   # Assign built-in User Access Administrator RBAC role, because granting RBAC access to other resources during the cluster creation will be required at subscription level (such as AKS-managed Internal Load Balancer, Azure Container Registry, Managed Identities, etc.)
   az role assignment create --assignee $GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_PRINCIPALID --role 'User Access Administrator' --scope "/subscriptions/$(az account show --query 'id' -o tsv)"
   ```

1. Create secrets in your GitHub repository. The secrets contain the important information about the federated identity that the GitHub Actions workflow uses.

   ```bash
   GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CLIENTID=$(az deployment group show -g $SHARED_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_AKS_MRB -n shared-svcs-stamp --query 'properties.outputs.githubFederatedIdentityClientId.value' -o tsv)
   echo GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CLIENTID: $GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CLIENTID

   SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
   echo SUBSCRIPTION_ID: $SUBSCRIPTION_ID

   gh secret set AZURE_CLIENT_ID -b"${GITHUB_FEDERATED_IDENTITY_CLIENTID}" -a actions --repo $GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB/aks-baseline-multi-region
   gh secret set AZURE_TENANT_ID -b"${TENANTID_AZURERBAC_AKS_MRB}" -a actions --repo $GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB/aks-baseline-multi-region
   gh secret set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID  -b"${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}" -a actions --repo $GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB/aks-baseline-multi-region
   ```

1. In your GitHub repository, create the secrets for the base 64-encoded certificates used by Application Gateway and for the ingress controller.

   ```bash
   gh secret set APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_REGION1_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 -b"${APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_REGION1_CERTIFICATE_BASE64_AKS_MRB}" -a actions --repo $GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB/aks-baseline-multi-region
   gh secret set APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_REGION2_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 -b"${APP_GATEWAY_LISTENER_REGION2_CERTIFICATE_BASE64_AKS_MRB}" -a actions --repo $GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB/aks-baseline-multi-region

   gh secret set AKS_INGRESS_CONTROLLER_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 -b"${AKS_INGRESS_CONTROLLER_CERTIFICATE_BASE64_AKS_MRB}" -a actions --repo $GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB/aks-baseline-multi-region
   ```

1. Copy the GitHub workflow file into the *.github/workflows* directory, which is a special directory that GitHub Actions looks for.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   sed "s/##SHARED_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_AKS_MRB##/${SHARED_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME_AKS_MRB}/g" github-workflow/aks-deploy.yaml > .github/workflows/aks-deploy.yaml
   ```

1. Generate a cluster parameter file for each region.

   Verify all variables are populated:

   ```bash
   echo CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_03: $CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_03 && \
     echo CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_04: $CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_04 && \
     echo TENANTID_K8SRBAC_AKS_MRB: $TENANTID_K8SRBAC_AKS_MRB && \
     echo OBJECTID_GROUP_CLUSTERADMIN_BU0001A004203_AKS_MRB: $OBJECTID_GROUP_CLUSTERADMIN_BU0001A004203_AKS_MRB && \
     echo OBJECTID_GROUP_CLUSTERADMIN_BU0001A004204_AKS_MRB: $OBJECTID_GROUP_CLUSTERADMIN_BU0001A004204_AKS_MRB && \
     echo LOGANALYTICSWORKSPACEID: $LOGANALYTICSWORKSPACEID && \
     echo CONTAINERREGISTRYID: $CONTAINERREGISTRYID && \
     echo GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB: $GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB
   ```

    Update each region's cluster parameter file by using the sed command-line tool:

   ```bash
   # Region 1
   sed -i "s#<cluster-spoke-vnet-resource-group-name>#rg-enterprise-networking-spokes#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.eastus2.json && \
     sed -i "s#<cluster-spoke-vnet-name>#${CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_03}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.eastus2.json && \
     sed -i "s#<tenant-id-with-user-admin-permissions>#${TENANTID_K8SRBAC_AKS_MRB}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.eastus2.json && \
     sed -i "s#<azure-ad-aks-admin-group-object-id>#${OBJECTID_GROUP_CLUSTERADMIN_BU0001A004203_AKS_MRB}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.eastus2.json && \
     sed -i "s#<log-analytics-workspace-id>#${LOGANALYTICSWORKSPACEID}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.eastus2.json && \
     sed -i "s#<container-registry-id>#${CONTAINERREGISTRYID}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.eastus2.json && \
     sed -i "s#<your-github-org>#${GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.eastus2.json
   
   # Region 2
   sed -i "s#<cluster-spoke-vnet-resource-group-name>#rg-enterprise-networking-spokes#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.centralus.json && \
     sed -i "s#<cluster-spoke-vnet-name>#${CLUSTER_SPOKE_VNET_NAME_BU0001A0042_04}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.centralus.json && \
     sed -i "s#<tenant-id-with-user-admin-permissions>#${TENANTID_K8SRBAC_AKS_MRB}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.centralus.json && \
     sed -i "s#<azure-ad-aks-admin-group-object-id>#${OBJECTID_GROUP_CLUSTERADMIN_BU0001A004204_AKS_MRB}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.centralus.json && \
     sed -i "s#<log-analytics-workspace-id>#${LOGANALYTICSWORKSPACEID}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.centralus.json && \
     sed -i "s#<container-registry-id>#${CONTAINERREGISTRYID}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.centralus.json && \
     sed -i "s#<your-github-org>#${GITHUB_USERNAME_AKS_MRB}#g" ./azuredeploy.parameters.centralus.json
   ```

1. Push the changes to your fork of this repo. The workflow is triggered when a push on the `main` branch is detected.

   > :book: This flow works for both new or existing AKS clusters. The workflow deploys the multiple clusters in different regions, and configures the desired state for them.
   >
   > The app team monitors the workflow execution as it runs, because it affects a critical piece of infrastructure.

   ```bash
   git add -u && git add .github/workflows/aks-deploy.yaml && git commit -m "Customize params and setup GitHub CD workflow" && git push origin main
   ```

   > :bulb: You might want to convert this GitHub workflow into a template, especially if your organization or team needs to handle multiple AKS clusters. For more information, see [Sharing Workflow Templates within your organization](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization).

1. Select your fork as the default repo you're working with locally.

   ```bash
   gh repo set-default
   ```

1. Wait for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete successfully.

   ```bash
   until export GH_WF_STATUS=$(gh api /repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs/$(gh api /repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs -q ".workflow_runs[0].id") -q ".status" 2> /dev/null) && [[ ${GH_WF_STATUS} == "completed" ]]; do echo "Monitoring GitHub workflow execution: ${GH_WF_STATUS}" && sleep 20; done
   ```

1. Retrieve the cluster names for regions 1 and 2 from the deployment output.

   ```bash
   export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03_AKS_MRB=$(az deployment group show -g rg-bu0001a0042-03 -n cluster-stamp --query properties.outputs.aksClusterName.value -o tsv)
   export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04_AKS_MRB=$(az deployment group show -g rg-bu0001a0042-04 -n cluster-stamp --query properties.outputs.aksClusterName.value -o tsv)
   echo AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03_AKS_MRB: $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03_AKS_MRB
   echo AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04_AKS_MRB: $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04_AKS_MRB
   ```

1. Validate whether there are any node image updates available. Because AKS cluster in region 1 and 2 were only just deployed, it's very unlikely that any updates will be available.

    ```bash
    az aks nodepool get-upgrades -n npuser01 --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03_AKS_MRB -g rg-bu0001a0042-03 && \
      az aks nodepool show -n npuser01 --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03_AKS_MRB -g rg-bu0001a0042-03 --query nodeImageVersion && \
      az aks nodepool get-upgrades -n npuser01 --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04_AKS_MRB -g rg-bu0001a0042-04 && \
      az aks nodepool show -n npuser01 --cluster-name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04_AKS_MRB -g rg-bu0001a0042-04 --query nodeImageVersion
    ```

    > Typically, base node images don't contain a suffix with a date (i.e. `AKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd`). If the `nodeImageVersion` value looks like `AKSUbuntu-2204gen2containerd-202402.26.0` a SecurityPatch or NodeImage upgrade has been applied to the AKS node.

    > Node images in regions 1 and 2 could differ if recently shipped images didn't arrive in a particular region. As part of day2 activities, consider monitoring the release status by region at [AKS-Release-Tracker](https://releases.aks.azure.com/). Releases can take up to two weeks to roll out to all regions from the initial time of shipping due to Azure Safe Deployment Practices (SDP). If your AKS node images in regions 1 and 2 are required to be on the same version you should consider updating the node images manually.

1. Install kubectl 1.28 or newer. (kubectl supports ±1 Kubernetes version.)

   ```bash
   sudo az aks install-cli
   kubectl version --client
   ```

1. Get AKS `kubectl` credentials.

   > In the [Microsoft Entra ID Integration](02-auth.md) step, we placed our cluster under Microsoft Entra group-backed RBAC. This is the first time we are seeing this configuration being used. The `az aks get-credentials` command sets your `kubectl` context so that you can issue commands against your cluster. Even when you have enabled Microsoft Entra ID integration with your AKS cluster, an Azure user has sufficient permissions on the cluster resource can still access your AKS cluster by using the `--admin` switch to this command. Using this switch *bypasses* Microsoft Entra ID and uses client certificate authentication instead; that isn't what we want to happen. So in order to prevent that practice, local account access such as `clusterAdmin` or `clusterMonitoringUser`) is expressly disabled.
   >
   > In a following step, you'll log in with a user that has been added to the Microsoft Entra security group used to back the Kubernetes RBAC admin role. Executing the first `kubectl` command below will invoke the Microsoft Entra ID login process to authorize the *user of your choice*, which will then be authenticated against Kubernetes RBAC to perform the action. The user you choose to log in with *must be a member of the Microsoft Entra group bound* to the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole. For simplicity you could either use the "break-glass" admin user created in [Microsoft Entra ID Integration](03-microsoft-entra-id.md) (`bu0001a0008-admin`) or any user you assigned to the `cluster-admin` group assignment in your `cluster-rbac.yaml` file.

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials -g rg-bu0001a0042-03 -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03_AKS_MR --format azure
   az aks get-credentials -g rg-bu0001a0042-04 -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04_AKS_MR --format azure
   ```

   After the authentication happens successfully, some new items will be added to your `kubeconfig` file such as an `access-token` with an expiration period. For more information on how this process works in Kubernetes refer to the [related documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens).

1. Run the following commands to verify that `kubectl` has been authenticated against Microsoft Entra ID.

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03_AKS_MRB
   kubectl get nodes --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04_AKS_MRB
   ```

1. Ensure Flux in region 1 and 2 has created the workload namespaces.

   :bulb: notice that both namespaces are Kustomization overlays, and as such they were customized to be annotated with the region number.

   ```bash
   # press Ctrl-C once you receive a successful response
   kubectl get ns a0042 -o yaml -w --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_03_AKS_MRB

   # press Ctrl-C once you receive a successful response
   kubectl get ns a0042 -o yaml -w --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_BU0001A0042_04_AKS_MRB
   ```

### Save your work in-progress

```bash
# run the saveenv.sh script at any time to save environment variables created above to aks_baseline.env
./saveenv.sh

# if your terminal session gets reset, you can source the file to reload the environment variables
# source aks_baseline.env
```
